## Insight

- Working with URLSearchParams is not very ergonomic (with symbols API, set/append) You have to go through hoops and loops to make [arrays](https://dev.to/nerdyman/replacing-query-string-with-native-urlsearchparams-4kdg) works and they have to be in [specific format](https://blog.shalvah.me/posts/fun-stuff-representing-arrays-and-objects-in-query-strings). [query-string](https://www.npmjs.com/package/query-string) is much simplier and stright forward to work with especially when you have set how URL params must look like (arrays, objects) because of how some API works.
