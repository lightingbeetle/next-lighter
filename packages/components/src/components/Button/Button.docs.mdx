# Button

Buttons are control elements used for navigating and operating a page and form submission.

<Button>Button</Button>

## Variants

### Basic

The `<Button />` component can render as `<a>` or `<button>`. Take care to always use the appropriate element:

- `<a>` if it takes you somewhere (on page or elsewhere)
- `<button>` if it does something (controls a section, submits a form, etc.)

  </Button>
</Preview>

## Props

<Props component={Button} />

## Accessibility

The `<Button />` component can render as `<a>` or `<button>`. Take care to always use the appropriate element. The rule of thumb is to use `<a>` if it takes you somewhere, `<button>` if it does something and `<button type="submit">` if it's used for submitting a form. Check the articles below for more information.

### Don't disable buttons

Especially form submit buttons. A disabled button is not keyboard focusable. Instead of using the `[disabled]` attribute, it's advised to rather use `[aria-disabled=true]` - it still remains focusable, and a screenreader can find it and announce it's contents, along with the information that it's disabled.

Users should be able to submit incomplete and invalid forms, and should get relevant validation feedback, which explains what went wrong and how to fix it. It's considered a bad practice to let the user figure out thier errors themselves.

### Icons

While it's recommended to always show a textual label acompanying an icon, this rule is often broken. When this happens, always make sure there is a textual alternative readable by assistive technology. There are three options:

- `[aria-label]` on the button element OR
- alt attribute on the icon OR
- a visually visually hidden but accessible element (e.g. `.sr-only`)
